Please ensure that the emissions of the budget and those of the base or reference year refer to the same emissions in terms of content. For example, if the emission budget covers emissions from land use change, the emissions in the base and reference year should include emissions from land use change as well.<br />
The pre-filled figures refer to the global CO2 emissions including emissions from land use change. The budget used is based on a global emission budget of 420 Gt from 2018 on, which was lowered by the emissions of the years 2018 and 2019. 2010 was chosen as a reference year. Regarding the global emission budget, we refer in particular to the IPCC Special Report 2018 (<a href = 'www.ipcc.ch/sr15/' target = '_blank'>www.ipcc.ch/sr15/</a>).<br />

 An important question concerns the possibility of future negative emissions. The app allows you specify the potential for net negative emissions by specifying a percentage that is applied to the current emissions. This percentage then determines the negative minimum value of the emission paths by 2100. An indication of 0% is equivalent to net zero emissions by 2100. Setting a positive value as minimum would not make sense in the given context, because the given emission budget would be exceeded through the emissions after the year 2100.<br />
 If net negative emissions are allowed, the budget may be temporarily exceeded. These overshoot amounts will then be offset by net negative emissions by 2100. However, it should be noted that the overshoot amounts can also lead to dangerous <b>tipping points</b> in the climate system being exceeded. Also, it should be pointed out that the <b>costs</b> of actively capturing CO2 are still unclear and that there are major methodological and substantive problems in <b>quantifying</b> sinks and questions regarding their sustainable value.<br />
 The actual overshoot amounts per scenario type are displayed in the table above the emission paths.<br />
